		<p>Discussing the effect of electromagnetic waves on 	human brains the author introduced the 	   latest
			research results conducted by the scientists and facts about the influence of wave on the human
			brains and cancer development. Extensive usage of smartphones has an effect on human’s upper
			extremities, back, and neck. Studies in this area show a significant association between the total times spent using mobile device each day and pain in the right shoulder and between times spent internet browsing and pain at the base of the right thumb. This research was supported by a surveyto identify the side-effect of using smartphones and hand-held devices among users between15-
			64. The detailed survey results are discussed in the main paper.
			“Mass cellphonization” revealed proponents and opponents of cellphone users. Cellphones’
			proponents state that devices enhance safety, deliver education, improve transparency and root out
			corruption, strengthen democracy and provide access to the market, while opponents see various
			health risks and nature pollution.
